abstract = { The variability of configurable systems may lead to configuration-related issues (i.e., faults and warnings) that appear only when we select certain configuration options. Previous studies found that issues related to configurability are harder to detect than issues that appear in all configurations, because variability increases the complexity. However, little effort has been put into understanding configuration-related faults (e.g., undeclared functions and variables) and warnings (e.g., unused functions and variables). To better understand the peculiarities of configuration-related undeclared/unused variables and functions, in this paper we perform an empirical study of 15 systems to answer research questions related to how developers introduce these issues, the number of configuration options involved, and the time that these issues remain in source files. To make the analysis of several projects feasible, we propose a strategy that minimizes the initial setup problems of variability-aware tools. We detect and confirm 2 undeclared variables, 14 undeclared functions, 16 unused variables, and 7 unused functions related to configurability. We submit 30 patches to fix issues not fixed by developers. Our findings support the effectiveness of sampling (i.e., analysis of only a subset of valid configurations) because most issues involve two or less configuration options. Nevertheless, by analyzing the version history of the projects, we observe that a number of issues remain in the code for several years. Furthermore, the corpus of undeclared/unused variables and functions gathered is a valuable source to study these issues, compare sampling algorithms, and test and improve variability-aware tools. },

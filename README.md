# autotransplantation4spl
Software Product Line (SPL) is a software reuse approach that improves time-to-market and software quality, achievingsubstantial cost reductions. These benefits do not come for free. It often takes years to rearchitect and reengineer a code base tosupport SPL and, once adopted, it must be maintained. Current practice relies on a collection of tools, tailored for different reegineeringphases, whose output developers must coordinate. To speed conversion to and maintenance of SPL, we present FOUNDRY, the firstsoftware transplantation approach that transplants and merges features from different systems without creating or manually adaptingthe assets specifically for an SPL, as the assets are collected from diverse existing systems and automatically adapted.We realised FOUNDRYinPRODSCALPEL, a software transplantation tool for SPL that facilitates feature identification and can efficientlytransplant a multi-organ, i.e., a sequence of features. We usedPRODSCALPELto create two product lines and derive two products thatcontain features from three real-world systems each. We also compared it with manual effort, showing thatPRODSCALPELis able tomigrate features between different codebases within 4 hours, time limit within which expert SPL developers have not finished the task.When the same codebase for the host and the donor was used,PRODSCALPELwas able to migrate a feature within an average of48min, compared to an average of 1h21min of developer effort.
